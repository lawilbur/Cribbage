This game was created using HTML, CSS, javascript, and JQuery. I tried to mimic a game of Cribbage but found writing out all the conditions to be more complicated then I had thought.
The game currently only plays through the first few steps of the game including making and randomizing the deck, creating the hands, allowing the players to choose cards for the crib and running through the 'Play' portion of the first round.
